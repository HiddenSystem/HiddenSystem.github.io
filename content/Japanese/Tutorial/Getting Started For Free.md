# Getting Started For Free

## A six month progress report

These are the steps I've followed to study japanese for free.

TL;DR Follow Morg's tutorial, but use JPDB.io for vocab and Bunpro for grammar. You can use Jlab's Anki deck but Anki itself takes a lot of tweaking to actually be good.



#### Common Misconceptions

There is no intermediate plateau. There's just 30k+ words of Japanese to learn:

You don't need to swap to JP only definitions:
