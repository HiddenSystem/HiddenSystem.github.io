# Trails Series (軌跡)

TL;DR 10/10 series, go play it

## If you've never played a Trails Game

I'm mostly going to use this section to list what I personally enjoy about the series, and what makes it worth your time

The Trails Series I've heard described as the MCU, but anime. Where a lot of the (in this case) games are part of the same universe, and influence each other, culminating eventually with an "Avengers: Infinity War" style game at the end of the series
    - Liberl Arc (Sky FC, SC, 3rd)
    - Crossbell Arc (Zero, Azure)
    - Erebonia Arc (Cold Steel 1,2,3,4), with 3 and 4 being "Avengers" style
    - Summary/Epilogue game (Reverie)

First off, the series is inheritently niche, each game is a story-focused turn-based JRPG, that takes its time to build the characters and world.

What I find as pros might instead turn you off the series. That's fine, but I do hope that if you find any of the below points appealing, that you try out the series

- Top quality and well-rounded characters, banter, and world-building. This includes the antagonists, and also everyday NPCs
  - The important part about this is the attention to detail. There aren't just mundane NPCs that direct the main protagonist towards their objective, but have their own lives and worries.
  - Another point is that the main protagonist and other characters are very grounded. You don't play the "chosen one" who has to save the world, but instead you play a character who's trying to live their own life, in a town of people who are also living their own lives.
    - What this amounts to, is that there's no distinction between what's "important" information, and what is just banter, because the level of detail is the same for both
      - You can have full on conversations with the local bakery owner for example
    - I've heard there a similar difference in the storytelling between WoW classic and WoW retail, and I greatly prefer a story with more grounded characters
  - The world-building and developing relationships are shown naturally as you visit the various areas throughout the game.
    -  This also takes a really long time, usually a large portion of an entire first game in an arc. This is not everyone's cup of tea, and turns away a lot of players. 
       -  However as a consequence, relationships develop very naturally and you really understanding the motivations for character's actions, and you feel the same pain as you go through tribulations
    - The first games of arcs are usually filled with a lot of low-stakes objectives, for example: Finding a girl's lost cat
      - These can feel mundane, but I consider them a vital portion of the world-building. It depends on if you like slice-of-life stuff
  - In terms of antagonists, I really like where their viewpoint makes sense and you can say they "have a point", or at least a reason to do what they do, and I dislike pure evil characters
    - This boils down to having well-rounded characters in general
- Top quality overarching story and plot, that is unique, complex and unpredictable. This includes political struggles and interpersonal struggles, often intermingling
  - There are games with good characters and banter, but pretty average stories, such as the Tales series, so I'm making a distinction here between characters and story
  - I consider a predictable plot to be very generic, and as a huge negative. The Trails stories always contains subtle hints towards the direction of the plot, but still always suprise me, and I consider that a huge plus
    - I can't really elaborate without spoiling stories, but I will say that I don't think I've seen a person who has beat the first game in a series, then not want to immediately play the next game in the series.
      - If you get past the hurdle of playing one of the games fully, then you're probably already hooked and will play all the other games
  - There is a general intermingledness between the 3 arcs (Cold Steel, Sky, Zero/Azure), but imo the crossover is overblown and it's fine to start playing any of the first games of each arc first
    - That said, from a purist mindset, you "should" play them in Japanese release order (Sky fc,sc,3rd, zero, azure, cs1 to 4),
      - Mostly because the later games spoil a few parts of the earlier games, as they happen later in the in-game timeline
      - When a historical event happens offscreen, it has a lot more weight if you've experienced it firsthand
      - When characters appears from an older game and it says, "it seems that they have a lot of history together", you really feel that
      - That said, even if you didn't play the earlier games, you can just assume the character is a minor character, but some scenes might not evoke the same emotions
        - All you really miss is "Oh I remember that guy" from previous game moments
        - But I mean you can just replay the game later, after beating the previous games if you really want to
- Good traditional JRPG combat
  - If you like turn based JRPG combat, then you'll like it. If you don't like turn based JRPG combat, ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
- Turbo Button Exists
