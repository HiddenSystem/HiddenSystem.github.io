# Trails Series (軌跡)

TL;DR 10/10 series, go play it

## If you've never played a Trails Game

I'm mostly going to use this section to list what I personally enjoy about the series, and what makes it worth your time

The Trails Series I've heard described as the MCU, but anime. Where a lot of the (in this case) games are part of the same universe, and influence each other, culminating eventually with an "Avengers: Infinity War" style game at the end of the series
    - Liberl Arc (Sky FC, SC, 3rd)
    - Crossbell Arc (Zero, Azure)
    - Erebonia Arc (Cold Steel 1,2,3,4), with 3 and 4 being "Avengers" style
    - Summary/Epilogue game (Reverie)

First off, the series is inheritently niche, each game is a story-focused turn-based JRPG, that takes its time to build the characters and world.

What I find as pros might instead turn you off the series. That's fine, but I do hope that if you find any of the below points appealing, that you try out the series

- Top quality and well-rounded characters, banter, and world-building. This includes the antagonists, and also everyday NPCs
  - The important part about this is the attention to detail. There aren't just mundane NPCs that direct the main protagonist towards their objective, but have their own lives and worries.
  - Another point is that the main protagonist and other characters are very grounded. You don't play the "chosen one" who has to save the world, but instead you play a character who's trying to live their own life, in a town of people who are also living their own lives.
    - What this amounts to, is that there's no distinction between what's "important" information, and what is just banter, because the level of detail is the same for both
      - You can have full on conversations with the local bakery owner for example
    - I've heard there a similar difference in the storytelling between WoW classic and WoW retail, and I greatly prefer a story with more grounded characters
  - The world-building and developing relationships are shown naturally as you visit the various areas throughout the game.
    -  This also takes a really long time, usually a large portion of an entire first game in an arc. This is not everyone's cup of tea, and turns away a lot of players. 
       -  However as a consequence, relationships develop very naturally and you really understanding the motivations for character's actions, and you feel the same pain as you go through tribulations
    - The first games of arcs are usually filled with a lot of low-stakes objectives, for example: Finding a girl's lost cat
      - These can feel mundane, but I consider them a vital portion of the world-building. It depends on if you like slice-of-life stuff
  - In terms of antagonists, I really like where their viewpoint makes sense and you can say they "have a point", or at least a reason to do what they do, and I dislike pure evil characters
    - This boils down to having well-rounded characters in general
- Top quality overarching story and plot, that is unique, complex and unpredictable. This includes political struggles and interpersonal struggles, often intermingling
  - There are games with good characters and banter, but pretty average stories, such as the Tales series, so I'm making a distinction here between characters and story
  - I consider a predictable plot to be very generic, and as a huge negative. The Trails stories always contains subtle hints towards the direction of the plot, but still always suprise me, and I consider that a huge plus
    - I can't really elaborate without spoiling stories, but I will say that I don't think I've seen a person who has beat the first game in a series, then not want to immediately play the next game in the series.
      - If you get past the hurdle of playing one of the games fully, then you're probably already hooked and will play all the other games
  - There is a general intermingledness between the 3 arcs (Cold Steel, Sky, Zero/Azure), but imo the crossover is overblown and it's fine to start playing any of the first games of each arc first
    - That said, from a purist mindset, you "should" play them in Japanese release order (Sky fc,sc,3rd, zero, azure, cs1 to 4),
      - Mostly because the later games spoil a few parts of the earlier games, as they happen later in the in-game timeline
      - When a historical event happens offscreen, it has a lot more weight if you've experienced it firsthand
      - When characters appears from an older game and it says, "it seems that they have a lot of history together", you really feel that
      - That said, even if you didn't play the earlier games, you can just assume the character is a minor character, but some scenes might not evoke the same emotions
        - All you really miss is "Oh I remember that guy" from previous game moments
        - But I mean you can just replay the game later, after beating the previous games if you really want to
- Good traditional JRPG combat
  - If you like turn based JRPG combat, then you'll like it. If you don't like turn based JRPG combat, ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
- Turbo Button Exists

## Maybe spoilerinos ahead


### Trails to Azure

TL;DR My favorite game so far. Go play it

TLDR for myself,  (cause im too lazy to write a full thing, but I want to remind myself later of the plot, cryptic maybe spoilers ahead)

Master Quartz is fun, lets you have more customization

The political talk was really well written

Are you negligent/responsible if you are a doctor, you could cure cancer, but you choose not to

Trolley problem

Randy is a cool character

Parts where you go wtf is going on (in a good way). Good stuff

Beating up the people who wronged you was fun

Antagonists have good motives

Doggy

KeA

Ilya

Guy

shizuku portrait is cursed

y'know, that thing that happens in the last chapter, that was good

y'know, that thing that happens in the final dungeon in the last chapter, that was good

y'know, that happens in the last fight in the final dungeon in the last chapter, that was good

Feels they held back on Zero to let it all out on Azure

### Trails of Cold Steel 3

Chapter 1 impressions:

So far, the story sucks, but the gameplay is fun. It might just be the stark jump between Azure and CS3 though in terms of style and all.

In general, if you like the gameplay of JRPGs, you'll be having fun

Story
- New chars that I don't care about yet that you have to babysit
- The recurring cast are all like, "Remember the good ol' days", instead of actual new content
- Theres so many chars that there isn't enough time given to really flesh out any single group of chars
- These chars are very anime tropey at the moment (I think all of cold steel is more anime trope-y compared to the older games, by design probably)
- bathing bonding moments is a bit weirdchamp

Gameplay (Nightmare difficulty)
- Brave Orders are op, but fun.
  - Especially the defensive ones, I feel like as long as shields are up, you can't really die except through insta kills
- The game is still challenging while making you feel op, which I feel like would be hard to do, but they accomplish that somehow
- Even more customizability from 2 master quartz
- GUNNER! STRIKER! 
- Hearthstone is pretty fun, better than blade

Chapter 2:
- girls go cooking/guys go to computer class, hmmm
- The "reveals" are just plot dumped after boss fights, it feels a bit forced
- I do like the gameplay loop of getting your old party members a lot better than in CSII
- Randy's personality feels a lot more beta compared to his Ao/Zero counterpart, which is kinda sad
- New class people I kinda, I think they're just alright still. Nothing special
- I like the new outfits for the recurring cast
