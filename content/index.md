# Hidden System

Hi, I'm Hidden.

Welcome to my slice of the internet.

This website contains a random assortment of notes written in [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) style on my Japanese learning journey, as well as some personal reviews of things I've played or seen.

Name of the website inspired by [morg.systems](http://morg.systems), a resource I used starting my Jananese learning journey
